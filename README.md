# Semantic-Modelling-for-Text-Images-Cross-Model-Retrieval
Semantic modeling is a crucial component in cross-modal retrieval as it
bridges the semantic gap between various modalities, such as text, images,
and audio. The challenge in information retrieval from different modalities
stems from the complex nature of extracting semantic information. This project
aims to bridge the semantic gap between text and images by tackling the
challenge of understanding the high-level semantic meaning shared across
these modalities. The motivation behind this work is its potential application in
enhancing search engines, digital libraries, and accessibility tools.

RQ : How to establish the semantic similarity between images and text for
cross-modal retrieval?
